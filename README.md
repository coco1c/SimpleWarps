The SimpleWarps plugin is a Minecraft plugin that enables players with the appropriate permissions to create public warps. Players with the warp permission can use the command '/warp (warp name)' to teleport to these locations. Admins have the additional ability to use '/warp (warp name) --force' to bypass the cooldown.

Users, if granted permission, can access the warp menu (/warps) and teleport to specified warps listed in the config file. Additionally, you have the option to choose the particles and sound that will accompany the teleportation process.
